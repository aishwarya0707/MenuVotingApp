Project overview
--About
Company needs internal service for its’ employees which helps them to make a decision on lunch place.

Each restaurant will be uploading menus using the system every day over API Employees will vote for menu before leaving for lunch on mobile app for whom backend has to be implemented There are users which did not update app to the latest version and backend has to support both versions. Mobile app always sends build version in headers.

Needed API’s:
o Authentication o Creating restaurant o Uploading menu for restaurant (There should be a menu for each day) o Creating employee o Getting current day menu o Voting for restaurant menu (Old version api accepted one menu, New one accepts top three menus with respective points (1 to 3)) o Getting results for current day

Requirements:
Solution should be built using Python and preferably Django Rest Framework, but any other framework works App should be containerised Project and API Documentation • Tests

Extra points
HA Cloud Architecture Schema/Diagram (Preferably Azure) Usage of Linting and Static typing tools

Project structure
The project is divided into 2 smaller apps. They are • users - Contains logic related to User login, logout, register, employee creation • restaurants - Contains logic related to restaurants, voting and menus

MODELS:
Restaurant Menu Vote Employee

END POINTS:
Create a restaurant --> /restaurants/create-restaurant/
Uploading menu for restaurant --> /restaurants/upload-menu/
vote for restaurant menu using old version api or new version api --> /restaurants/restaurant-votes/
Getting results for current day --> /restaurants/current-day-menus/
New users can be registered --> /users/register/
Users can login --> /users/login/
Users can logout --> /users/logout/
Employee can be created --> /users/create-employee/
